# 🍔 **Create your own fast food empire!** - 

Welcome to **our family project**, created from wild children's dreams and lots of love! ❤️  

**The story?** It's simple: the children wanted their own computer game. Dad wants to teach them how to handle money and find out for themselves how to automate their work as programmers using ChatGPT (and the like).  

The whole thing is a **fun project**, and the children are constantly coming up with new [ideas](Ideen-Board.md) - not all of them always have something directly to do with a snack. (For example, a bat is supposed to be flying around soon. 🦇🍟)  

**Join us on our journey and have fun developing the snack game together!

## 🚀 **What is it?**  
The game is a fun simulation in which you build your own fast food business:  
- 🍟 **Sell plenty of fries and burgers:** Without smelling like chip fat all day.
- 📈 **Learn accounting (without yawning):** Budget like a pro - or go broke and try again!  
- 🛠️ **Write your own plugins:** Add new customer types, food or fun game mechanics - the code is open for your creativity!
- 🤖 **Use AI tools:** We use modern AI tools whenever possible to explore their strengths, weaknesses and possibilities in programming.  


## 🧐 **Why should you take part?**

### 1. **Be part of a creative journey:**  
We don't just build a game, we also have a lot of fun coming up with new ideas. Whether you can program, have a creative wish or just want to test - your support is welcome!

## 🍟 **How you can help:**  

1. **Test the game:** Download it, try it out and tell us what you like (or don't like).  
2. **Co-program:** Take a look at the open tasks (issues), e.g:  
   - Write your own plugins for new food or customer types.  
   - Contribute great graphics - whether new burgers, funny customers or fancy animations.  
3. **Share ideas:** Open an issue and let us know what you're thinking about. You don't have to be a pro - we love creative posts!  
4. **Motivate us to stay on the ball:** Write us feedback, send us ideas or just a few words of encouragement. Every message motivates us to keep going!

## 🛠️ **How to get started:**  

1. clone the repo:  
```bash  
npm install -g local-web-server
git clone https://github.com/daudiihhdau/imbiss-spiel  
cd imbiss-spiel  
ws --spa index.html
```

Then open the game in the browser at http://localhost:8000.
Press F5 if there are no customers. Another random location will then be loaded.
Don't be surprised if the screen is dark at the beginning. The snack bar opens at night and the sun rises later 😉

## 🌟 **Our vision:**  
The snack game is our joint leisure project. We want to have fun, learn new things and be creative. We are constantly thinking of new ideas that we should incorporate. How about more garbage on the streets, a scolding customer - or a frog that hops past for no reason 😉  

It's not about building a marketable game. We want to build something cool together with you and laugh about our ideas.

---

## 🎯 **The first playable version:**  
Here are the next milestones we want to achieve:  
- Customers have requests (e.g. “I want a cheeseburger!”)  
- Customers order their food  
- Customers pay for their orders  
- Display statistics at the end of the day (e.g. revenue, expenditure, number of customers)  
- A new day begins (incl. reset for customers and stocks)  
- At the beginning you can set the starting assets and a target (e.g. “€1,000 profit”)
